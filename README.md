<p align:'Justify'>This is an ERD of six tables: Salaries, Titles, Manager,Employees, Departments, and Department Employee. A SQL table schema was created for each of the six CSV files using the ERD. Primary and Foreign Keys were added. When necessary, composite primary keys were created for a table.</p>

<p align:'Justify'>Each CSV file was imported into the corresponding SQL table in the same order that the tables were created to avoid errors.</p>
